# Hitham-Mobile-app
## MOTIVATION FOR THE PROBLEM
The main motive is to create an interactive interface that helps the students of Hitham organization improve their music activities and collect appropriate feedback . They can have collection of songs on their device, so they can play them, and the teacher can get feedback about their activities and can manage accordingly. 
This is the project which is being deployed. We will get exposure to minute detailing of project development life cycle. We will get the chance to learn new technologies. Some practical scenario of understanding user requirements which one needs to understand and design the application, this is a good addon.
